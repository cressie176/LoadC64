<P>
This chapter is mostly aimed at people who are used to older VICE releases. The
default configuration has shifted from "make the emulator fast enough to work
on consumer hardware" to "pedantic focus on emulation accuracy", which is why
newer releases have been perceived as "slower" by some people.

</P>
<P>
However, a couple things can be reverted and "improved" - if better performance
is what you can afford to trade for a little less emulation accuracy.
<STRONG>Note that if you encounter any strange problems, you should always try to
reset settings to default first.</STRONG>

If you are coming from WinVICE to GTK3, you might want to restore the original
WinVICE hotkeys. Go to
Options-&#62;Host-&#62;Hotkeys-&#62;Load From,
and navigate to data/hotkeys/hotkeys-winvice-legacy.vhk
